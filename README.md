# Plagiarism-Detection-System-Machine-Learning-Project

Objective: Successfully Implemented a robust plagiarism detection system leveraging advanced Multi-Model Machine Learning Techniques
• Engineered a text preprocessing pipeline and applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform raw text into feature vectors for the model input
• Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Random Forest & Naive Bayes for plagiarism detection
• Achieved maximum accuracy of 92% with SVM and utilized PyCharm for the seamless deployment and testing of the detection system
